Binary Tree :

Types of Traversal methods :

Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for Binary Trees are ways to traverse nodes of the Binary Tree. This article aims to provide the basic difference between BFS and DFS for Binary Tree.

A Tree is typically traversed in two ways:
1)Breadth First Traversal (Or Level Order Traversal)
2)Depth First Traversals

1)Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
2)Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
3)Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
